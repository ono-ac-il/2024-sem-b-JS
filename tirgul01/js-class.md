### Simple Explanation

1. **Class**: Think of a class as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (characteristics) and methods (actions) that the objects created from the blueprint will have.
2. **Properties**: These are the characteristics of the object. For example, if you have a class for a `Car`, properties might include `color`, `model`, and `year`.
3. **Methods**: These are the actions that the object can perform. For the `Car` class, methods might include `startEngine`, `drive`, and `stop`.

### Simple Demonstration

Let's create a class for a `Car`.

```javascript
// Define the Car class
class Car {
  // The constructor method is used to initialize properties
  constructor(color, model, year) {
    this.color = color; // Property: color
    this.model = model; // Property: model
    this.year = year;   // Property: year
  }
  
  // Method: start the engine
  startEngine() {
    console.log(`The engine of the ${this.color} ${this.model} (${this.year}) is now on.`);
  }
  
  // Method: drive the car
  drive() {
    console.log(`The ${this.model} is now driving.`);
  }
  
  // Method: stop the car
  stop() {
    console.log(`The ${this.model} has stopped.`);
  }
}

// Create an object from the Car class
const myCar = new Car('red', 'Toyota Camry', 2022);

// Use the object's methods
myCar.startEngine(); // Output: The engine of the red Toyota Camry (2022) is now on.
myCar.drive();       // Output: The Toyota Camry is now driving.
myCar.stop();        // Output: The Toyota Camry has stopped.
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Define the Car Class**:
   - The `class` keyword is used to define a new class.
   - The `constructor` method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with the class. It sets up the initial properties (color, model, year).

2. **Properties**:
   - Inside the constructor, `this.color`, `this.model`, and `this.year` are used to set the properties of the object.

3. **Methods**:
   - `startEngine()`, `drive()`, and `stop()` are methods that define actions the car can perform.

4. **Create an Object**:
   - `const myCar = new Car('red', 'Toyota Camry', 2022);` creates a new `Car` object with specific properties.

5. **Use the Methods**:
   - `myCar.startEngine()`, `myCar.drive()`, and `myCar.stop()` call the methods on the `myCar` object to perform actions.

This simple example demonstrates how to define a class, set up properties, and create methods in JavaScript.
